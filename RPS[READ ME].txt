Feel free to use the code as you see fit, though I doubt you
will want to.

############################

This will be my first attempt at making a simple python game.

My game of choice will be Rock, Paper, Scissors.

There will be a function to keep track of the user's record, a function
for the computer's choice, and a prompt for a user's input.

The input should be either the first letter, or the word of choice.

This is just for practice, there aren't any real applications for this code
outside of just something to have fun with.
